Description:

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Solution:

This one is easy. Use the HashSet<T> which only allowed for unique values to store the numbers. Loop through the array, if the Hash Set contains the number already, returns true, else, add the number to the Hash Set. Return false outside of the for loop because that implies that every number in the array is unique.
