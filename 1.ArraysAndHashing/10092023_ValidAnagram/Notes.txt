Description:

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Solution:

1. Sort and compare:
    If the two strings are not of the same length, return false
    Else, sort the two strings, then compare them
  
2. Compare unique characters
    If the two strings are not of the same length, return false
    Put the characters of the strings in two dictionary and count their frequency
    Compare the two dictionaries:
      If the counts are different, return false
      For each key in the first dictionary,
        if the second dictionary doesn't have the same key, return false
        if the value of the two dictionaries don't match, return false

    return true in the end because it implies that all keys and values match.
